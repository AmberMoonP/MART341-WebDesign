              <h2>Step 1: Gather Materials</h2>
                <p>Suggested Materials and tools:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>4-5lbs of clay</li>
                    <li>Hump mold or other mold of your choice. You may also choose to forgo the mold and have a flatter plate, but remember that an arch will hold its shape in the heat of the kiln better than a flat surface.</li>
                    <li>Serrated rib(s) and a smooth edge rib</li>
                    <li>Sponge</li>
                    <li>Cutting tool or knife</li>
                    <li>I also recommend a banding wheel, but it's mostly for convenience and ease. Optional!</li>
                  </ul>

              <div>
                <h2>Step 2: Make Your Slab</h2>
                  <p>Throw or roll your slab to be about a quarter of an inch or a bit thicker. Use your serrated rib and smooth rib to compress the clay, and add or remove any texture you want to see on the top surface of your plate. I opt for smooth because my decorating process involves applying slip and carving, but you might choose to leave some texture depending on your decorating style.

                <h2>Step 3: Mold &amp Shape</h2>
                  <p>Apply your slab to the mold. Make sure to spend some time compressing the slab to the mold with a rib. Use your cutting tool to cut the plate into whatever shape you want! I've been using this irregular rectangle shape lately, but I've done round, hexagonal, triangular, and more. Just remember that your plate will shrink in both the bisque firing and the glaze firing, so take your desired size into consideration when cutting the plate's shape.

                  <h2>Step 4: Add a Foot</h2>
                    <p>Add clay in whatever way you'd like to create a foot for your plate. You can get creative here! I like to go for an elegant line into my foot, so I add a chunk of clay that I then refine with the rib tool.

                  <h2>Step 5: Refine</h2>
                    <p> I like to refine in a few phases.</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>First, when the clay is still quite wet, I use my rib to scrape and move the clay into place. I even do some trimming during this phase.</li>
                        <li>Most people do this next stage in the leatherhard phase, for good reason. However, I've found that working in the bone-hard phase works best for my own work. Use whatever trimming tool you want to finish refining the shape of your plate.</li>
                        <li>Finally, use a sponge to smooth away any texture that you don't want. If I'm going for an extra smooth surface, I'll gently sand it in it's bone-hard phase.</li>

                          <p>When working in this way, there are some things to consider:</p>

                    <h2>Step 6: Decorate</h2>
                      <p> Decorating is totally up to you and your style. Plates offer a beautiful, simple surface with lots of opportunities that a smaller, curved, or more complicated vessels often do not. Have fun!
