# Assignment 9 HW #

1. This week it felt really good to go back through and review everything we've done up to this point. I feel like it solidified for me what's feeling like it's sinking in, and which elements are still confusing that I need to spend more time practicing. I'm still most confused about forms and tables, but as I practice and play, I'm getting the hang of it.

2. I'm excited to start learning CSS, I hope it will help my webpages look a little less like they're from the 90's...

3. Some successes are when I'm able to write the code without having to refer to notes, some things are starting to feel natural. The challenges continue to just be things I need to slow down and take time with. I spend a lot of time reviewing notes, and also just making changes to code and looking at the results, and adjusting and playing until it resembles what I'm going for.
