            <h2> Why did I choose this instructable? </h2>
            <p> I am a ceramic artist, and in the last year or so have moved from wheel-thrown pots to handbuilding. I've made this transition because I like the hand-made look. I also enjoy the process more, it fits me better. Plates are on the more difficult side to make whether you're hand-building or throwing and I know a lot of potters who avoid making them! I did, for a long time. This is a relatively easy way that I've found, that offers many options for each artist to add thier own personal touch and aesthetic into the process. My instructable isn't intended as a step-by-step for someone to make a plate just like I do, but rather to give them the general idea so they can maybe have a new way, some new tools, or a place to start. You can find examples of some finished work on my Instagram page.</p>
