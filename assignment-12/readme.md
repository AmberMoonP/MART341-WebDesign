1. The difference between padding, margin, and borders is where they are in relation to their box, though they are all ways of delineating and establishing space around content. A border is usually decorative and consists of lines or dashes, but can also be used to create cushion around an element. Padding is space between the inner part of the element and the element itself, so for example, the padding between the words in a text box, and the edges of that box. Margins are the space around the outside of an element. Again, if we have a text box, the margin would be the space between the edge of that text box and the edge of a surrounding element, or the edges of the page.

2. This week felt like the most challenging yet. I think maybe some areas that we've covered up to this point that weren't really solidified became very confusing. After talking with Professor Cassens, some of those things made sense but some others still  seemed difficult to grasp. I also feel like there are some things I missed along the way. For example, you can have multiple classes within a class's double quotes, but they need to be separate on the styles sheet. I guess I thought that each class had to have it's own class tag in the index.html. I got my page somewhat functional, but I don't like how it looks, visually. I'm wondering if I tried to get too clever with it, and maybe that was my downfall.
