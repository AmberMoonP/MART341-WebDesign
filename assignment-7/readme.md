# Homework 7 #

1. I've encountered email subscription forms, buttons, multiple choice and long answer responses, among others. The purpose of these forms is for the page owner to be able to collect data for various reasons. For example, an email subscription form allows the page owner to get a hold of the visitor. Multiple choice questionnaires allow page owners to collect specific answers from visitors.

2. Example of a text input is when you enter your name or birthday or password- this is usually to verify your identity.

An example of a selection input could be a year, a state, or anything else that might be an option in an organizable list.

An example of a button input might be a subscribe button, a start button, an icon button. The purpose of a button is usually to direct you to another site or page.

3. My work cycle this time around felt a little rougher than last week. I really have had a hard time with the forms, and didn't have enough time between a very busy work week and my other classes to really dive in to review. The coding felt a bit clunky to me, I wasn't sure in certain places in my index.html how to transition from one form to another, but I just kept playing with it until the page looked somewhat organized.
