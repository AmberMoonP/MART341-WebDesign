# Assignment 8 HW #
1. Differences between divs, classes, ids, and spans:

    Divs: areas divided on a page horizontally, creating a row from one side of the page to the other. Used for media, such as a gallery. Divs can be singular or nested.  

    Classes: This groups similar elements, an element can have more than one class element, and this is used in styling. It's like an ID but many elements can be grouped by a class.

    IDs: Describe an element, and is used to style an element independently.

    Span: This creates a slider!

2. The advantage of using a third-party service such as YouTube is that compatibility across browsers is often built in. The disadvantage is that it is usually content that doesn't belong to you, which is risky when it comes to copyright infringement. It also means that you don't have control over the media failing.

3. This week felt very challenging. I had a hard time mentally piecing together what elements and attributes went where. I also had a hard time understanding escape characters, though I successfully used one in my code. I gather that they're used for readable characters that might be used in code, and it's another way of writing them so that the browser doesn't get confused? Embedding videos was easy, though a little confusing because I thought I had to nest the <iframe> elements within a <video> or <audio> element, but it didn't work until the <iframe> element was independent. The way that I've been working through issues is just pushing my origin, looking at my page, and going back and playing with code until it works on the page. I actually think this is a really effective way for my brain to learn, and have the information stick! My success for this week was getting my headings, embedding a picture, and adding the media files to my page on the first try! The embedded YouTube video and Soundcloud audio file took a few tries.
