            <div><p>This website is a culmination of my development in digital arts over the last four months. I had no prior digital design experience before this semester. As a beginning to a multi-disciplinary degree at the University of Montana, I pursued a certificate in Digital Design and accomplished this goal in one semester. It was a beautiful experience, going from no experience at all and honestly feeling pretty insecure about my computer and technical skills in general to feeling like my art was elevated to a new level overall. I look forward to pursuing graphic design more in the future, and am seriously considering furthering my digital design education after my bachelors degree. I had a particular fondness for developing book covers and event posters!
          <br />
          I am a professional dancer, ceramic artist, and visual artist. I came to Montana in 2013 for a dance contract in Helena, and moved here permanently in 2017. </p>
