1.

-System Font: A font that you find on your computer in a program such as Microsoft word. These fonts are not the same from system to system.

-A web font is a custom font hosted on a server, like Google Fonts.

-A web-safe font is a font that is almost guaranteed to work on any system, some examples include Arial, Georgia, and Times New Roman.

2. It's important to have fallback fonts or a font stack in the case that a browser or system that a user is on can't access the indicated font. This allows you to keep your webpage looking closer to how you intended (by choosing similar fonts) if it fails, rather than the browser default totally changing it.

3. Pseudos. I still am struggling to figure out how to write pseudos into the index and into the css. I think I got the "visited" one to work but not the hover? I'm really not sure if they got working or not.... I also feel like the lag between when you push a change and when it shows up on the webpage is frustrating because you can't see instantly if the changes took effect, and so it's hard to know whether to give it time or if it didn't work.
