# Homework 6 questions#
1. It seems like you are only supposed to have one head and one body element per page to keep things organized. The head contains the "thoughts" of the page, things like it's title, metadata, and style information whereas the body contains what will be visible to visitors on the page.
2. Structural markup is the coding that makes stuff appear, such as paragraphs, headings, hyperlinks and so on.

Semantic markup is the code that gives the content meaning for the browser, this includes things like attributes.
3. My work cycle for this assignment felt more streamlined and efficient than in past assignments. I wrote the general structure for my entire readme before filling in the details rather than just writing from top to bottom. I think this ensured consistency and that I had closing tags for everything.
