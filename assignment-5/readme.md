I chose to take a look at Nasa.gov in The Wayback Machine for the years 2011 and 1999.
Today, Nasa's website is very interactive but still reflects Nasa's commitment to current science. In 1999, there was still current news and updates, but only in picture and article format. Today, there is a feed of live updates for missions, a link to a Live Youtube video, and about as many space-related articles and resources a girl could dream of.

As we've transitioned from markdown to html, the coding hasn't been too challenging, but figuring out my repository and file/folder organization, as well as getting it onto Github has felt challenging. Learning how to utilize Github Desktop has alleviated much of this.
