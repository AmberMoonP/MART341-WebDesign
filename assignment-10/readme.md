# Homework 10 Questions #
1. The difference between different selector types:
      -an asterisk * is a universal selector, it will apply to everything on the page.

      -an id will apply to an individual corresponding id attribute in the class, an element can have only one ID attribute. I would use this if, for example, I had 5 div sections, and I wanted them all to be the same in every way except for one needed to be a different color.

      -a class attribute is a way to group attributes for different elements. Different elements can share a class name, and an element can have more than one class.
      
      -an element is within the <> tags, and can be styled directly within the element. For example: <body style="color: white;">

2. I picked black, gold, and white for my colors. I was trying to get a vintage, yet flashy look to go along with my 20's theme.

      -Black: 0, 0, 0: # 000000

      -FloralWhite: 255, 250, 240: # FFFAF0

      -Gold: 255, 215, 0: # FFD700

3. I feel like I was kind of getting a handle on simple styling in the <style> section of html. For some reason transferring it to a css felt confusing and disjointed. I also realized I've kind of been avoiding ID's and class attributes, and applying them here felt like a lot! I also was having a hard time seeing what was actually being affected when I made changes to the css. As always, a lot of experimentation and extra research made all the difference!
